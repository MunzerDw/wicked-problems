# wickedproblems.io

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis where I developed an application (frontend & backend) for visualizing wicked problems. During development, I had two separate repositories. However, this one is a public repository to view the full code.

## Development

I have included the pages of my thesis where I explain in details how the application was built.

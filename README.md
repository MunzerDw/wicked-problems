# wickedproblems.io

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis where I developed an application (frontend & backend) for visualizing wicked problems. During development, I had two separate repositories. However, this one is a public repository to view the full code. Since there are specific environment variables and secret firebase keys needed to run the code, I have not included any commands.

You can visit <https://wickedproblems.io> and create an account. Please note that it is not mobile responsive. The application is being used today by the chair of Information Systems at the department of informatics at Technical University of Munich.

## Development details

I have included the [pages of my thesis](https://github.com/MunzerDw/wicked-problems/blob/main/docs/development_details.pdf) where I explain in details how the application was built.

# [wickedproblems.io](wickedproblems.io)

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis where I developed an application (frontend & backend) for visualizing wicked problems. During development, I had 2 separate repositories for frontend and backend. However, since they include Github secrets and have a long commit history, I put both codes into this one repository. You can visit <https://wickedproblems.io> and create an account. Please note that it is not mobile responsive. The application is being used today by the chair of Information Systems at the department of informatics at Technical University of Munich.

## Frontend

To start the frontend client on your local machine (port 3000):

1. Navigate to /frontend and install dependencies
```shell
cd frontend
yarn
```
2. run code in dev environment
```shell
yarn develop
```
## Backend

Similar to the frontend, to start the backend services on your local machine (port 4000):

1. Navigate to /backend and install dependencies
```shell
cd backend
yarn
```
2. run code in dev environment
```shell
yarn dev
```

## Development details

I have included the [pages of my thesis](https://github.com/MunzerDw/wicked-problems/blob/main/docs/development_details.pdf) where I explain in details how the application was built.
